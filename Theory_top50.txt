1.	What is a Test Environment?

A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware for the testing teams to execute test cases. In other words, it supports test execution with hardware, software and network configured. Test environment configuration must mimic the production environment in order to uncover any environment/configuration related issues.
A typical Environmental Configuration for a web-based application is given below:
Web Server – IIS/ Apache
Database – MS SQL
OS – Windows/ Linux
Browser – Chrome / FireFox
Java version – version 6

2.	What is the difference between build and release?

The main difference between Build and Release in Software Testing is that Build is a version of a software the development team hands over to the testing team for testing purposes while Release is a software the testing team hands over to the customer. 
Build refers to the standalone software artefact generated after converting the source code to an executable code that can be run on a computer. A release, on the other hand, is the distribution of the final version of an application. Thus, these definitions explain the fundamental difference between Build and Release.
•	What is Build in Software Testing?
After developing the software module, developers convert the source codes into a standalone form or an executable code. Then the development team hands over the build to the testing team to perform testing. Build is in the testing phase; it may have already undergone testing or not. Software testing team checks this build. If it consists of multiple bugs and if it does not meet the requirements, then the software testing team rejects that build.  Builds occur prior to the release, and they are generated more frequently.
•	What is Release in Software Testing?
The release is the final application after completing development and testing. After testing the build, the testing team certifies that software and delivers it to the customer. It is possible for one release to have several builds. Therefore, it is the software delivered to the customer after completing the development and testing phases. Moreover, the release is based on builds, and it can have several builds.

3.	What are the phases of testing?

1.	Unit Testing
Is the first level of testing and it involves testing individual modules of the software. It is usually performed by developers.
2.	Integration Testing
Is performed after unit testing. In integration testing, we test the group of related modules. It aims at finding interfacing issues between the modules.
3.	System Testing
Is the level of testing where the complete software is tested as a whole. The conformance of the application with its business requirements is checked in system testing.
4.	Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing is the final stage of the QA test cycle. It helps evaluate if the application is ready to be released for user consumption. Typically, testers carry out this phase with the help of the representatives of the customer who test the application by using it. Therefore, they will check if the application can perform all the functions specified.
